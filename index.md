## Who I am (in brief)

I am an emerging artificial intelligence and innovation professional with an entrepreneurial mindset, a pragmatic approach and a strong creative drive.

## What I believe

University for me was never a stage, but a laboratory of possibilities. I chose to study computer science not to become a pure technician, but to understand the digital world - to one day be **able to transform it from the inside.**

**I believe that entrepreneurship is not taught, it is practiced.** That is why I combined my academic studies with practical projects, working with professors and technicians who helped me combine theory and practice. I believe in the transformative power of technology when it is driven by human values and strategic vision and I learned that ideas only become powerful when they are tested in the real world.

## Where I am going

My direction is clear, although the path is built step by step: I want to **work in roles where creativity, strategy and technology are intertwined.** Roles that require systemic thinking, vision and the ability to build - be it products, experiences or businesses.

I am interested in everything at the intersection of technological innovation and human impact, and **my goal is to actively contribute to building a more original, inclusive and meaningful future.**
