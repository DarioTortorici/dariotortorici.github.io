## About me
  
I am an artificial intelligence and innovation professional with an entrepreneurial mindset, pragmatic approach, and strong creative drive.

I am passionate about **creating original things with a high social impact that don't yet exist**. I am committed to leveraging technology to create meaningful solutions that prioritize human values and align with a strategic vision for societal progress.

Throughout my academic journey, I developed skills in designing and optimizing business processes with artificial intelligence, applying theoretical knowledge to real-world problems in companies.
