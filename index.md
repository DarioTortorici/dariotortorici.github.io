## About me
  
I am an emerging artificial intelligence and innovation professional with an entrepreneurial mindset, pragmatic approach, and strong creative drive.

I am passionate about creating original things with a high social impact that don't yet exist. I believe in the transformative power of technology driven by human values and strategic vision.

During my academic studies, I gained a solid foundation in designing and optimizing AI-driven business processes, and I worked with several companies to develop custom AI solutions for real-world challenges.
