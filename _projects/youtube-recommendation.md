# Why a Youtube Recommender?

Youtube is the largest collection of videos and for this reason sometimes it is not easy to understand before clicking if the video is relevant for learning purposes or if it is at your level.

To address this, I've developed a Flask application that recommends videos tailored to your specific level and interest in different topics.

If you'd like to try it out or help me improve it, this is the [github repository](https://github.com/DarioTortorici/youtube_recommendation)

## Prerequisites

The website runs locally, and needs:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Google API Client Library (for YouTube API)
- YouTube Data API Key

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or feature suggestions, please submit a pull request.
