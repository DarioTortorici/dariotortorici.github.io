This academic project was developed for the Automated Planning course and consists of five exercises that progressively increase in complexity within a hypothetical healthcare scenario. The project begins with classical planning and evolves through temporal and hierarchical planning, ultimately integrating with a ROS2 environment. Both the code and the final report can be found [here](https://github.com/DarioTortorici/Planning-project).
