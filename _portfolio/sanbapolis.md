This thesis focused on developing a web-based platform to streamline the management of training session recordings in the sports sector, providing a technological infrastructure to support the companies involved.  

During my internship, I designed and implemented a web platform using HTML, PHP, and JavaScript within a LAMP stack to manage and analyze training session recordings.
The internship was part of an interdepartmental project aimed at modernizing sports facility technologies, particularly in light of Italy’s role as host for the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics. With several disciplines set to take place in Trentino, this presented a unique opportunity to equip newly constructed venues with cutting-edge digital infrastructure.
The main objectives of the project were to define the requirements for transforming sports venues into smart facilities, and to serve as a real-world trial to address the infrastructure challenges associated with digital transformation in sport.

As part of this initiative, I collaborated with multiple university departments to integrate their research and technological solutions into the platform. The platform was successfully tested in a sports arena used by professional teams, including Aquila Basket and Trentino Volley’s women’s team.  

In the final proof of concept, the platform enabled teams to access live footage, review past recordings, and create annotated clips, significantly enhancing training analysis and performance evaluation.
