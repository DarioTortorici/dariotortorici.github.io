[Girardini](https://www.girardini.it), an Italian company established in the early 1940s, is specialized in mold design and construction, cold stamping, and powder coating of technical sheet metal components.
The company propose as a challenge leveraging Artificial Intelligence to develop a system for effective predictive maintenance aimed at minimizing downtime.

Leading an international, cross-functional team of industrial engineers and AI engineers, I guided the project from business understanding to development of the proof of concept model.

In my leadership role, I ensure alignment with the development team and business goals, facilitating regular meetings with the company to gather requirements, provide updates and analyses, and refine the solution based on their real-world needs.

The solution implemented was a Graph Neural Network (GNN), which successfully reduced downtimes by 10%. This improvement translated into a +0.05 point increase in the company's Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE).
