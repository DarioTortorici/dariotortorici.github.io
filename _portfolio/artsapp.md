# What is ArtsApp

In today's world, fine artists struggle to gain visibility and art curators find time consuming the creation process of an exhibition.
ArtsApp is a matchmaking platform that makes it easy to manage exhibitions and apply for.

> As curators, we spend 80% of our time on non-artistic tasks.

The solution will allow artists to express themselves and curators to streamline the process in an all-in-one platform.

# Founders

* [Alessandro Corradi](https://linkedin.com/in/alessandro-corradi-21a348300) StartUp creator.
* [Giacomo Giori](https://linkedin.com/in/giacomo-giori-713342254) An artist himself.

# My contribution

I partnered with the Founders from the inception stage, guiding them through two comprehensive cycles of validation and financial analysis. Currently, while no longer directly involved in the executive project, I serve as a Board Advisor, working with the founders to refine business strategies and optimize development processes.

# Actual situation

As of my latest update on June 23, 2024, Artsapp is in the pre-seed stage and actively seeking investors and strategic partners (Exhibithion venues, Publishers and others). If you are interested in collaborating or investing, please feel free to contact me.
