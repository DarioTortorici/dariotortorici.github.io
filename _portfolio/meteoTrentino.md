MeteoTrentino is a structure of the Autonomous Province of Trento founded in 1997. It counts
more than 100 hundred weather stations all over the Trentino region.
The challenge proposed by MeteoTrentino is to use Artificial Intelligence to make up a code able to effectively detect anomalies in the real-time data and be integrated in the protocol to generate the
alerts, thus supporting the operator in charge of data quality control in his work.
As part of a multidisciplinary team of computer scientists and physicians, I contributed to the development of an LSTM-based anomaly detection system. My role focused on the implementation, optimizing the model to improve detection accuracy. The model can be found [here](https://github.com/eliazonta/AI-Challenge-HIT-2022). By leveraging this solution, we successfully reduced anomaly detection time from one week to just two days.
