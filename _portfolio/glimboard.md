GlimBoard is an interactive platform designed to inspire and train creativity through stimulating exercises. I purchased the domain in 2024 caught up in the excitement, but I'm now working on the project in the spare time locally. If want to help me develop it, contact me.

# Why

[As Simon Sinek suggest, I will start with the why.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA)
Creativity is not just for artists. Creativity is the foundation of problem-solving, innovation, and even our character. In a world where automation is replacing repetitive tasks, the only irreplaceable skill is the ability to think differently. If your job doesn't involve creativity, chances are it can already be automated. That's why I want to develop an app that enhances creativity, not as another dry educational tool, but as something truly engaging, because learning should be playful.

# How

When we were kids, learning was always fun, it happened through games. I never understood why playing is seen as something childish when, in reality, it's the perfect, risk-free space to experiment, make mistakes, and improve without fear. That's exactly the kind of experience I want to create with this platform: a collection of mini-games designed to spark creativity in a natural, enjoyable way.  

In addition, creativity thrives on collaboration, and I firmly believe that ideas are meant to be shared, challenged, and improved. That's why I'm putting this out here, and why I want the platform to have a social element, where users can exchange their own creativity-boosting challenges.

# What

GlimBoard is a platform, not a social network. The goal isnâ€™t to keep you endlessly scrolling but to actually boost your creativity. Both in your work and outside of it. You can use it to find inspiration from others or dive straight into the creative process by playing the mini-games yourself.
