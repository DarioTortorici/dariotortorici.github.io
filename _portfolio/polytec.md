For my master’s degree thesis, I developed a solution designed to optimize the logistics of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) in dynamic warehouse environments, focusing on the efficient management of both inbound and outbound orders. This project required several key developments, including the creation of a custom simulator for analysis, the implementation of a new Online Multi-Agent Path Finding algorithm for coordinated fleet movement, and the engineering of a Fleet Manager routine. The project improved company independence in providing tailored, custom solutions to their customers and enhanced the overall adaptability of the solution.
