# TLDR
I'm looking for a job, I should write LinkedIn posts but it's time consuming

---

# Article

I've almost completed my master's degree in AI, specializing in AI and Innovation. As much as I enjoy coding, I don’t see myself pursuing a career as a Software Engineer. I like coding, but for myself. I like DIY skills, but I don’t want to become a plumber. You get the point.
Right now, I’m looking for roles like **Innovation Program Manager, AI Product Manager, or Innovation Consultant** (and yes, if you have any interesting proposals, feel free to reach out). To differentiate myself for a more mixed business-technical role, someone suggested I should write LinkedIn posts that highlight this. Personal branding, they call it. Damn personal branding. I thought I was already building a brand just by writing these posts!
Of course, I’ll write some AI and Innovation case studies, because I genuinely enjoy it. But I have zero interest in becoming a "rockstar engineer." This idea comes from an article titled [Don’t be a rockstar engineer!](https://josvisser.substack.com/p/dont-be-a-rockstar-engineer) by the usual Jos Visser. The core argument is simple:

> The term 'rockstar' has been used for a long time to describe leading musicians, and more recently, to describe successful individuals in various professions, including software engineers. While rockstars might be charismatic and attract attention, they are not necessarily the best musicians in their bands.
> They often have attitudes and behaviors (like smashing hotel rooms or substance abuse) that can be highly destructive. Although companies are seeking 'rockstar engineers', and might be setting themselves up for issues since rockstars can be unstable and unproductive.

In order to be done properly, LinkedIn posts require time. Time that I’m not willing to spend just to become a ‘rockstar’. I’m still more curious about learning than about telling people what I know. Sure, LLMs can help with content creation.
I tried generating an editorial plan and a pilot post. I followed the right steps: niche positioning, values, tone of voice. The editorial plan was okay after some tweaking. The post was absolutely terrible. Either awkward, trivial, or generic. This still required 30 minutes.
If you think my weekly posts are the same effort, let me disagree:

> This blog serves a dual purpose: to reflect on my thoughts and to share them with others in search of meaningful dialogue. I write first and foremost for myself, but I also write to connect with those who might share their thoughts on the topic I write about.
> — Me, my first blog post

I know, quoting yourself is weird. Last egocentric thing I’ll do here, I promise.

I will be writing some case studies on AI and innovation. When that happens, I will also post on my Linkedin. Until then, I will be looking for a job selling fewer tickets for my concert.
