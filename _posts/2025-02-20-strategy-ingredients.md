# TLDR
Strategy is more than just a collection of tactics. Seth Godin has identified four core ingredients to help you create yours.

---

# Introduction

Strategy is the philosophy of becoming. You need absolute clarity on the change you seek to make and who you want to change. Thinking of strategy as a collection of tactics is reductive. Tactics change, strategy does not. To understand my strategy, I have broken it down into the four core ingredients discussed by [Seth Godin in an interview with Tim Ferriss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhc1sM2NnQY): system, time, games and empathy.

# System

The system is invisible. It is hidden in the shadows and operates without us being aware of it. This is a not a conspiracy theory, society runs on automations. In life we need automations to save mental energies, every time we do something in a given context just "because it works this way" or because "it has always been done this way", well, we are moving within a system. As you can guess, it is a kind of matryoshka. Each context has its own rules and is most likely embedded in a larger context.
There are occasions when we become aware of its presence. Simply because they don't fit us. Changing it is not easy, because it is (sometimes unconsciously) programmed to be resilient to change. To change it would require a great deal of power within it, but paradoxically we are more likely to want to change a system from the outside, perhaps precisely so that we can then control it.
In such cases, the solution is to ‘enter through the back door'. I have heard this concept discussed by both Seth Godin but also [Alex Banayan in the podcast Colin and Samir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxkgaB4h9HM). There is no point standing in the queue at the entrance, knowing that the bouncer will bounce you. There is definitely (at least) another entrance.
Right now, I am following the "system of systems", the classic Western life script: School, University, Work, Marriage, Children, Retirement. Then, game over. This is the mother of all systems. If you're 30 you still haven't unlocked the achievement of marriage, the system makes you feel behind, even if you don't personally care. I am almost there in the world of work, another system to deal with. I would like to be an entrepreneur.
I want to leave an impact in this society and I believe entrepreneurship is the most effective way to leverage, resonate and my pleasure in doing so, of what can be achieved. What is the path to becoming an entrepreneur? come up with an idea, find two complementary partners, join an incubator, secure funding, exit. Fail at any stage? Start over.
I have an idea: [Glimboard](https://dariotortorici.github.io/projects/glimboard/), an interactive platform to train and inspire creative people. Exercises, tools, everything to help them create. I believe in it (though, let's be honest, every founder says that). But am I missing a back door? Maybe my first move should be working at a startup.
Maybe I should go to the U.S., [Jos Wisser's principle of centralization](https://josvisser.substack.com/p/wanna-career-move-to-the-center) suggests that's where the biggest opportunities are. But choosing where is already a tactic.

# Time

Strategy is about the long term. What you want isn't now, it's in the future. Your actions today should set up success tomorrow.

> We think Google’s going to get better every day. So we don’t want people to use Google for the first time right away. We want them to use it for the first time later so it’s better by the time they get there. So we’re not doing any promotion whatsoever because the Google of now only exists to get us to the Google of tomorrow.
> — Sergey Brin, in the early days of google

A good strategy has milestones, with tactics designed to reach them. My milestones are: get into the startup world, become a founder, solve people problems, change the rules of the game. If that doesn't happen? Then at least do a job that feels fulfilling. But fulfillment isn't a strategy.

# Games

Every situation involving multiple people is a game. Every move has a right or wrong outcome depending on your goal. The key is evaluation. Being able to measure the effectiveness of each move allows one to avoid making the same mistake over and over again. That's something I've been neglecting. How do you measure whether your moves are working?

# Empathy

The concept of empathy is different from the human one, and is mostly a model for businesses, but since everyone is their own personal brand (is and not has, [deliberately written](https://dariotortorici.github.io/blog/personal-branding/)), let's see if I too can draw some inspiration from this ingredient.
People buy because they feel the need to have that product. No matter how much effort you put into it, you have to build something for someone, to fill a need. This automatically excludes producing something for everyone. Everyone has different needs.

> When someone shows up at the Ferrari dealership and says, “I got six kids, how am I going to get them to school?” You don’t try to persuade them to get in an Enzo. You send them down the street to the Volvo dealership.
> — Seth Godin

What I am building with my personal brand is a food for thought on issues that are (in my opinion) important, while also putting myself out there. I think my peers are the group of people who might be more interested in my ideas. A kind of peer mentorship. So if you have read this far, I thank you and urge you to write to me with your opinions and strategies.

# Conclusion

By now, you should have an idea of your strategy. But there's one last trick Seth Godin gives us: Ask yourself: "if I knew this strategy would fail, what would I do differently?" More importantly "what would I do anyway?"
Because that's what really matters. That's what tells you who you are.
