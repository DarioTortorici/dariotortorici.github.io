# TLDR
Conversing with AI chatbots requires mental clarity in order to effectively express what you want. This allows you to truly understand your own needs.

# Article
Now that GPT-5 has been released, I can discuss the new, powerful model. The reality is that there's nothing to say. It's a good model, and it's more powerful than the previous one, but that's it.

Instead, I want to talk about the hidden benefits of AI chatbots. This is basically the opposite of my last post about the downsides of ChatGPT to our brains.

One thing that's been true since long before AI is that describing what you want in detail is one of the best ways to clarify your mind. That's why I write.

If you use LLMs effectively (LLMs at the moment),  you can develop skills such as knowing what you really want before asking. You can also improve your descriptive analysis by finding the right words for complex ideas. Lastly, you can learn to delegate, avoiding perfectionism and focusing on what's actually important for you to do instead of filling your day with non-core tasks.

These aren't automatic. Compared to the problems, these benefits only happen if you use the technology in a critical way.

And as history has shown us, the ones born with a technology tend to squeeze the most out of it. Our children might become better managers than we ever were.
