# TLDR
Messi has always been a leader, but someone still has the military's vision of leadership.

# Misconception of leadership

I recently watched [Martin Gutman's TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DU06c7f9fzc), and I have to thank him for articulating something I've been thinking about for a long time.  

> We confuse a good story with good leadership.
> — Martin Gutman

The more a leader dodges bullets, the better they are, right? Well, not if they're the one who pulled the trigger in the first place (which, more often than not, is the case). Meanwhile, we fail to recognize those who make things look effortless. If something seems easy, the Dunning-Kruger effect kicks in, and suddenly, everyone thinks they could do it too.  

For years, people said Messi lacked charisma.

> *See the marketing move? I know football (soccer) is more popular than F1, so I'm drawing a parallel with this topic instead. I'm joking, this example actually means a lot to me because it perfectly illustrates what leadership is, at least in my eyes.*  

Some argue Cristiano Ronaldo is better because Messi isn't a "leader". Even Diego Maradona, a god among Argentinians and Napoli fans, once said:  

> "He's a great player, but he's not a leader. It's useless trying to make a leader out of a man who goes to the toilet 20 times before a game."  
> — Diego Armando Maradona

Imagine hearing your idol say that about you. But even Maradona was wrong, he was stuck in the old-school stereotype of a leader, the kind defined by gritty attitude rather than impact. I think that this perception is a leftover from military traditions.  

So, when did this "Messi lacks leadership" narrative really start? Right after tough losses. Not surprising. Yes, he lost big matches. But he also won a ton. And the argument that he "wasn't playing well in those losses" is ridiculous. If the standard for leadership is flawless performance every time, I'd be terrified to meet anyone who thinks they can live up to that. Messi can't do it, and I certainly can't do it either.

And what about when he wins? He makes leadership look so effortless that people don't even realize he's doing it. A quiet, introverted guy, leading his team without needing to talk much. If we keep overlooking that kind of leadership, we'll keep choosing managers based on psychopathic traits, because that's what a "strong general" looks like.

Messi never wanted to be a leader, but his talent made it his responsibility. On the pitch, when things get tough, everyone looks to him. That's leadership in its purest form. If you have a question, who do you ask? The person who knows the answer. If you don't know where to go, who do you follow? Your leader.

And Messi knows it. Look at his teammates, there are clips of them talking about how they'd give everything for him, because they know he gives everything for them. That's leadership. Maradona was right about one thing: you can't force Messi into the traditional definitionof a leader. He's too humble for that. But maybe humility is exactly what real leadership requires.  

I once read a quote (I think it was Simon Sinek, but don't hold me to it):  

> A leader is someone who moves things forward.  

Messi has always done that. When his team struggles to progress the ball, he drops back, even to the defensive line, to make sure it moves forward. That's leadership, right there.  

I'm not saying that being an introvert has helped him as a leader, but when you need to get things done, whatever the situation, you should be able to shape your approach, and that's definitely something Messi has had to learn the hard way. After losing three finals (two Copa Américas and a World Cup), he wanted to quit the national team. Maybe that's not a leader's attitude, but it was important for me to understand that he was a human being.

He didn't retire. Instead, he learned. He understood that his final missing piece was communication, his ability to inspire through words. The switch happened in the 2021 Copa America final. And this time, [Messi spoke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-FGYH6AkXg).

> "He said that we had all rowed in the same direction from day one. That he was proud of the young players for their commitment to this jersey. That if they were there and had given everything at the Copa América, it was because they more than deserved it." [...] "Once he finished, everyone was in tears. It touched all of us, especially the young players."  
> — Ángel Di María

That's leadership. That's the GOAT in a soccer field.
