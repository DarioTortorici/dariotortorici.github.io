# TLDR
The 7 Rules of Power, my thoughts on it and how Flavio Briatore's life fits with the book.

---

# Introduction

I've recently read the book "[The 7 rules of power](https://jeffreypfeffer.com/books/7-rules-of-power/)" by Jeffrey Pfeffer , because Jos Visser on one of its blog posts on [Wednesday Wisdom](https://josvisser.substack.com/) (worth reading, both article and the blog in general) said:

> One of the best books I read in the past few years {...} it made me understand why I am not more powerful than I am. Of the seven things (rules) {...} I do two things naturally and the other five things I would never want to do because that is just not who I am. And to top it off, I generally do not care enough about becoming more powerful to overcome this disinclination.
> — [Jos Visser on Wednesday Wisdom article "Embrace the plateau"](https://josvisser.substack.com/p/embrace-the-plateau)

With only one year left at university, I am already considering how to enter the job market in the most convenient way. I enjoy planning (funnily enough also in AI), but what "conveniently" means for my career is still something I must determine. This is why I read books like Pfeffer's. I am ambitious, yet I have never felt that joining a corporation as a typical junior employee would be the right experience for me. Do I have what it takes to be more powerful?

Halfway through the book, I had already absorbed Pfeffer's premises, yet I found myself deeply unsettled by them. Not because they were poorly written. On the contrary, the content struck hard against my core beliefs. Every successful person, according to Pfeffer, has in some way acted in ways that I would personally find dishonorable in pursuit of their goals.

> Too frequently I encounter people, either by email or in my courses, who initially express resistance, skepticism, discomfort, challenges, and similar feelings with the ideas I teach. Finding "depressing" the existence of these rules.
> — Jeffrey Pfeffer

I was reflecting on this while watching a video about Formula 1, a sport I am passionate about, particularly regarding the controversial final Grand Prix of 2021, where Lewis Hamilton lost the championship to Max Verstappen in the last lap. For those unfamiliar with F1, I won't go into unnecessary details, but this made me think about Flavio Briatore and how his career mirrors some of Pfeffer's principles.

> For those interested in Formula One, I was thinking about the analogy between the Latifi's Crash in Abu Dhabi and the [Crashgate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_Formula_One_crash_controversy) in 2008, that costed Felipe Massa the WDC. (Do you know that Massa has a [lawsuit to change the results of the championship](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5370659/2024/03/26/felipe-massa-crashgate-lawsuit-ecclestone-f1-fia/), exactly for the crashgate?)

Flavio Briatore is best known internationally for his time in Formula 1, but in Italy, he is equally famous as a successful entrepreneur. Intrigued by his controversial life and career, I decided to read _L'affaire Briatore_, a biography by Andrea Sceresini and Maria Elena Scandaliato (which, as far as I know, has no English translation).

**In this article, I will explore The 7 Rules of Power, my thoughts on it, and Flavio Briatore's life. Hopefully, in an intertwined way that keeps you engaged, because by the end, you will have a clearer understanding of what it truly means to be successful and whether it is even worth aspiring to.**

# Rule #1 Get out of your own way

Dr. Pfeffer initially considered writing the entire book analyzing Donald Trump's behavior but ultimately decided against it, as Trump is such a polarizing figure. Interestingly, a similar comparison between Trump and Flavio Briatore had already been made in the Italian version of [The Apprentice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apprentice_(American_TV_series)).
While Trump tested the entrepreneurial skills of contestants in the U.S. edition, Briatore played his role in the Italian version. This parallel immediately sparked my curiosity. Are there any similarities in their behaviours?

Dr. Pfeffer starts with the concept of confidence. He argues that many individuals sabotage their own success by being overly cautious or self-critical. To gain power, he advises individuals to take bold actions, stop second-guessing themselves, and embrace the confidence to pursue opportunities without fear of failure or judgment. This also mean **overconfidence**. I'm a confident person. I know myself well enough to be confident about what I can do and what I cannot (yet) do.
That "yet" in the parentheses is important because it highlights how much I value myself (and a human in general). Give me (or anyone) infinite time and resources and I will be able to accomplish any task. I believe that nothing can stop me from archiving anything except time (and willingness, of course, in real cases). I thought that was enough confidence to say that I have the first point. I was wrong.

Briatore always had this confidence, a childhood friend once said:
> He was a social climber, always was. He was not interested in money: he was interested in power.
> — Sceresini and Scandaliato

Briatore did not need to read Dr. Pfeffer's book to understand the dynamics of power: he is a natural. His life was marked by a series of strategic alliances that led him to leave the provinces and land in the city, then Milan, the Virgin Islands, until he reached his peak with Formula 1. He applied the first rule to the full, focusing on communicate his power, but not on maintaining expectations, but on alliances.

> Stop focusing on trying to figure out who you are. Instead, focus on who your allies and potential allies are. Become a student of the people whose support you need. The sooner you do, the faster you will develop the information and insights necessary for strategically building the alliances you need to succeed.
> — Jeffrey Pfeffer

But let's start from the beginning. The first time Briatore decides to take action, he opens a club and calls it _Tribüla_, an homage to the nickname he had been given, inspired by the Piedmontese expression for someone who struggles, who scrambles.

> He tries his hand at everything: tubes of toothpaste, safety bindings for skis, and more. He may not be _the Archimedes of Verzuolo_, but he gets busy, relying mostly on himself, his charisma, and his innate sex appeal.
> —  Sceresini and Scandaliato

Business, however, does not take off. Despite failure, Briatore will not change his view of himself; he is willing to apply the other rules in the book that he seems to have internalized all along.

Dr. Pfeffer argues that power and politics are neutral tools. This tools can be used for good or ill, depending on the intent and context. Political skill, argues Dr. Pfeffer, is a key predictor of workplace success, often misunderstood due to negative personal experiences.

Briatore was never directly involved in politics, but he surrounded himself with right-wing people in his life.

> On the right-wing, for Flavio, there were opportunities: there was a desire to do things, to take initiatives. It's like being in an orchard, with so many beautiful fruits waiting to be eaten. The man on the right is the one who stretches out his hand and picks them. The man on the left is too small. Or he does not want to bother. So what does he do? He criticises, he protests, he argues. That's how we saw it: being on the left always means that. It means being envious.
> —  Sceresini and Scandaliato

This is far more than confidence.  I don't share Briatore's political views, nor do I belong to the same social class.

> Social class distinguishes groups in their willingness to use "political" strategies or their success in doing so.
> — Dr. Pfeffer

Maybe this is not for me, some political strategies seem borderline ethical.

> The long refusal of English players to dive may have been an admirable cultural norm but they might have won more games if they had learned from Continental Europeans how to buy the odd penalty  
> — "Soccerconomics", Simon Kuper

Do I have the guts to dive to get my penalty?

# Rule #2 Break the rules

Rules are made to be broken. This is the classic sentence your friend use as an excuse for being late. However, this make him more powerful according to Dr. Pfeffer. The professor argues that rules and social conventions are often created to support those who already have power. People with power have more freedom to ignore rules, because they know they won't face consequences. So why play by a set of rules designed to put you at a disadvantage?
The point is that when you take a chance and break the rules, the fallout is often not as bad as you might expect. Most of the time, nothing happens. You don't achieve your goal, but you also don't suffer any major negative consequences. Of course, there are situations where breaking rules can have serious consequences, and you should be mindful of those risks. But most times, the worst-case scenario is not that bad, and the potential rewards are worth taking the chance.

> It is easier and often more successful and productive to just do what you want and to ask forgiveness for something that you have done instead of seeking permission for it beforehand.
> — Dr. Pfeffer

That's fair enough. Breaking social norms to achieve goals or create a surprise effect is something I'm willing to do, but it depends on the context. Rules? Well, there are rules and _rules_. Take Formula 1, for example. Flavio Briatore is a prime example of someone who pushed the boundaries of what's considered acceptable, breaking nearly every rule in the book. But in the world of F1, this kind of behavior is almost the norm.
Since I started watching F1, I can't recall a single season without at least some rumors of teams bending or outright breaking the rules. It's practically a part of the sport's culture. Every year, teams try to build machines that flirt with the edge of legality, hoping to avoid getting caught. This is what I mean when I say there are "rules and rules." Some are meant to be pushed to their limit, it's part of the business.
If I were to become a team principal in F1 (and yes, I'm available, feel free to contact me), I'd have this mentality. But there's a line I wouldn't cross. Briatore orchestrated situations that put people's lives at risk, like asking one driver to crash deliberately so the other could win, and risking the safety of mechanics and drivers with a burning car to save seconds at a pit stop. This is where the game stops and becomes something I can't condone.

Socially speaking, Flavio Briatore crossed another significant boundary: taxes. He doesn't pay taxes in Italy, having moved his official residence to Monaco, coincidentally one of the most tax-friendly regimes in Europe.

> In Italy towards the rich there is anger, social envy, that's why then so many rich people also hide from the taxman. They are intimidated.
> — Maurizio Crozza, famous Italian satirical comedian in a sketch while impersonating Briatore

 For his Italian companies, he's also known for employing strategies to minimize tax payments as much as possible. While this approach may give him some power, definitely it doesn't earn my respect.

> Briatore declares himself absolutely innocent: ‘I have never thought or had to evade taxes,' he says. ‘The companies that evade taxes are those that go wrong'. He was sentenced to serve one year and eleven months in prison with parole.
> —  Sceresini and Scandaliato

# Rule #3: Appear Powerful

From that last quote, we get a glimpse of how a powerful person communicates. Interestingly, Briatore hasn't always been powerful, but his tone and language have consistently through time. According to Dr. Pfeffer, power often stems from how you communicate, rather than being something that shifts after you gain influence. In this sense, Briatore has always nailed it.

> He does not lack character: he is a leader, he knows what he wants, and he knows how to get it.
> — Sceresini and Scandaliato

I'm still a bit skeptical about this idea. Sure, it's important to dress appropriately, network with the right people, and project an image of success. Presenting yourself as competent, authoritative, and successful, regardless of your current position, can indeed set the right tone and open doors. But there's another fine line here for me. Push this too far, and you become pretentious, and let's face it, nobody likes a pretentious person.

# Rule #4 Build a powerful brand

Ultimately, all this effort is in pursuit of the fourth rule: building a personal brand. Although Dr Pfeffer insists that it's not just about "developing a look" or curating your image, it's about doing as many things as possible to make yourself known. Visibility matters. I think this is one of the little things that Briatore did not do as much, but these were other times, no internet.
I have to admit that this point of Dr Pfeffer's is the reason why I publish these kinds of articles, even though I don't want anyone to read them, but if they do, at least they should find some of my ideas here to prove that I exist and that I'm a hypocrite (I'm aware that I'm breaking the third rule, sorry Dr Pfeffer if I've failed you).

> "Flavio Briatore has succeeded over time in establishing his name as a real brand, with the consequence that saying ‘Flavio Briatore' means describing a certain lifestyle characterised by worldliness, but never disassociated from managerial ability and dedication to work."
> — Sceresini and Scandaliato

I've already explored the topic of personal branding in another article [here](https://dariotortorici.github.io/posts/2024/04/personal-branding/), and Briatore's experience aligns with my main concern. Briatore became the person he worked so hard to project. But in doing so, was he ever really himself? Maybe that doesn't sound as terrible to you as it does to me right now, writing this. Maybe this wasn't a problem for Briatore too.
He seems to have fully embraced the character he created: living in extravagant homes, attending over-the-top parties, and surrounding himself with beautiful women. Or maybe it was a problem.

> If you had to define Flavio Briatore in just two words, which would you choose? [...] I would define him a lonely man.
> — An old Friend of Briatore in L'affaire Briatore

The risk is real. The question is: when you finally "become" your personal brand, will you like the person you've built?
It doesn't matter I guess for Briatore, that once became choose to forget the past and rewrite it retrospectively.

> One of the best ways to tell a story—particularly a flattering account of yourself you have developed—is to have others tell it on your behalf
> — Dr. Pfeffer

Briatore did, in fact he does not talk about the past and the site gives fake info on the story, he now lives in his reality and disavows what happened before. Maybe he always did.

# Rule #5: Network Strategically

> "Humans are social creatures, so most people do spend some of their free time interacting with others. The problem from the standpoint of Rule 5 is that much of this interaction is with family and friends, not with bosses, colleagues from work, or others who might be professionally useful."  
> — Dr. Pfeffer

This has never been the case for Briatore. From the _Tribüla_, life was around groups of "affairs," where networking wasn't just casual. Early in his career, Briatore naturally took on the role of what Dr. Pfeffer describes as the "broker," someone who connects parties that can mutually benefit from knowing each other. This ability, combined with the principle of "weak ties," gave him a powerful edge.

> "People to whom one is weakly tied are more likely to tap into different sources and social circles, and are therefore more likely to be able to provide non-redundant information and contacts."  
> — Dr. Pfeffer

This dynamic is precisely what propelled Briatore into Formula 1. His connection to Luciano Benetton wasn't born from deep friendship. After fleeing to the Virgin Islands to escape the prison sentence for tax evasion we discussed before, Briatore opened several Benetton franchise stores and played a significant role in expanding the brand's presence in the U.S. market.

> "Luciano is a very generous man. He regarded Flavio as a kind of elder son to whom he could offer an opportunity. Then again, Flavio had the panache, the brightness that Luciano never had. And that made him irresistible in his eyes. I don't think Luciano was aware of the warrants for Flavio's arrest, nor do I think he wanted to get involved in those matters. But they were friends. And if Flavio was in trouble, Luciano would step in to help him."
> — Sceresini and Scandaliato

As always, Briatore's charm was a deciding factor. Charm I do not possess. I want to be better at casual conversation, but I'm better at deep conversation with people I know well. I'm working on it, but I don't enjoy small talk. Although it's necessary to build rapport, I'm focusing on transitioning from small talk to more meaningful conversations with new people.
Getting back to Briatore, some time later, Luciano Benetton will catapult him into F1 and the Olympus.

# Rule #6 Use your power

> "The longer someone is in a position, the more opposition they will accumulate, the more precarious their position will become, and the more difficult it will be to get things done. Thus, because their time in a powerful role will be limited, people need to act quickly to accomplish their agenda."  
> — Dr. Pfeffer

When I first read this, it felt counter-intuitive. I don't typically think of people in power as being so transient. Sure, in politics, governments switch between ruling and opposition, but even then, those individuals I consider it powerful even in the opposition. This idea didn't immediately resonate with me, until the follow-up.

> "Instead, the more someone uses their power to get things done, including structuring the world around them and changing who works with and for them in ways that support themselves and their objectives, the more power they will have."
> — Dr. Pfeffer

And it's exactly what Briatore did. He didn't just sit on the power he'd accumulated; he used it to carve out a niche, restructuring his world to reinforce his position.

He returned to his roots and expanded on them, reviving his dream of owning restaurants with Crazy Pizza. He took his earlier experiences from running clubs in the Caribbean and opened Billionaire, a luxury brand synonymous with prestige and indulgence. And now, he's back in Formula 1 with Alpine (essentially the third rebranding and acquisition of the Benetton team)

# Rule #7 Success excuses (almost) everything

The subtitle is "... and why this is the most important rule of all". Indeed, it was the most difficult rule to digest.

> Most people want to believe that the world is a just and fair place and that folks mostly get what they deserve. As social psychologist Melvin Lerner noted when he developed the so-called just-world hypothesis, the idea of a just world provides people with a sense of predictability and control. Individuals love a feeling of certainty and influence over their environments. Believing in a just world means: follow the rules and you will prosper; break the rules, or laws, and you will suffer.
> — Dr. Pfeffer

I'm a believer.  A realist believer though. I know that in life, a good dose of luck is essential to getting ahead. But achieving something cheating by cutting corners (we started with F1 parallelism, I've not forgot it), it won't silence that inner voice telling me I could have done it the right way. Moreover, it's not just about personal pride, it's about respect for those who, like me, are playing fair.
The sad story is, that as Dr. Pfeffer taught us, if you have real power, you can get away with it anyway.

> The greatest perquisite the rich and powerful in this country possess is the ability to commit crimes with impunity.
> — Jesse Eisinger

Also Briatore got his impunity. The conviction for escape and evading arrest are no longer valid. The hands that  _Tribüla_ has always used to dig its way to success have been washed.

> "He is a self-made man, for better or worse. Everyone in Cuneo says that. Then, how he did it matters little to people."
> — An old Friend of Briatore in L'affaire Briatore

# Conclusion

First of all, if you've made it this far, congratulations! and a huge thank you for taking the time to read through my thoughts and this article. I'd love to hear your takeaways, so feel free to reach out and share them.

As for my final thought? I don't think I have the guts to become truly powerful. But I'm in my 20s, I already feel like I'm up against the world, and I'm going to chase what I want anyway. Maybe, just maybe, one day a student will use me as a case study, and Dr. Pfeffer will have to admit: "well, he's an exception".
