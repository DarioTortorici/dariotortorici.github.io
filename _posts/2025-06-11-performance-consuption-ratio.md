# TLDR
Try to write something about the content you consume and you will learn and consume better content.

# Introduction

Every time I click on an “interesting” video, article, or podcast, I get that tiny dopamine hit: _“Ooh, I'm learning something.”_ But one week later? Gone. What was that video even about?

And that's not a personal flaw. It's structural. Nowadays the knowledge on internet is huge.
The worst part? We often don't even search for interesting things, they find us. Which makes me wonder: what's the point of all this if 99% of thing doesn't sticks?

# Enter the Ratio

I started experimenting with a simple idea: track how much I consume vs how much I _produce_ from it. I do this already for books. Now I'm expanding it to everything.

What's the “ideal” ratio? Honestly, I don't know. Probably not 1:1, unless you want to turn it into a second job. For me, it starts with a question:  
**“Is this worth remembering?”**  
If yes, it counts. If not, it's just another thing I scrolled by. And yes, even the cute cat doing backflips is “content.” Don't cheat.

Try this for 2–3 days. You don't even need to write anything yet. Just notice. You'll start to see what your balance looks like, and what it _should_ look like.

## Rules to Make It Work

### Do

- **Use proper tools.** Notion, Obsidian, Logseq, or any note-taking system with backlinks or knowledge graphs. Markdown-based apps work well (I use Obsidian but Logseq or Docmost if you want open-source).
- **Do it immediately.** Stop every impulse of see something else. Do it right away.
- **Write.** Not audio notes. Not transcripts. Actual writing. It forces clarity.
- **Connect.** Every new note should link to at least one old one. It's hard at first. It gets addictive later.
- **Add your take.** Summaries are fine, but include opinions, open questions, or how you'd apply it. Reflection makes it stick.

### Don't

- **Use LLMs.** The goal isn't having perfect notes, it's building understanding. Don't outsource your own learning. You will have nothing left except one more .md file on your PC.
- **Worry about your numbers.** Too low? Too high? Doesn't matter. The ratio is an excuse to measure, and therefore be able to improve the metric value. Your pace will calibrate over time.
- **Over-engineer it.** You don't need 14 metadata fields and a color-coded emoji system. Write the title, paste the link (yes here is allowed the copy and paste), hit Enter, and write.

## Why Bother?

- **You'll relearn how to summarize.** Because you'll be too lazy (it's a feature not a bug) to transcribe everything. You'll learn to extract the essence.
- **You'll know if you understood.** If you can explain it, it's yours.
- **It'll stick.** Thinking costs effort. That effort becomes memory.
- **You'll see connections.** My favorite definition of intelligence is “the ability to connect knowledge.” You're building a network that reshapes how you see everything.
- **It'll change your digital diet.** You'll consume less, but better. Creation demands time, so you'll start spending it more intentionally.

## How to Keep It Sustainable

You might start with enthusiasm and quit after one video. That's normal. Here's how to avoid that:

- **Add a buffer system.** Can't write right now? Toss it into a to-do list or record a voice note to transcribe later.
- **Keep friction low.** No elaborate templates. No excuses. Make writing feel like brushing your teeth.

If you're familiar with [Bloom's Taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy), this shifts your digital intake from _remembering_ (level 1) to at least _analyzing_ (level 4). That's why it works.

Try it for 3–4 months. If you do, you'll eventually have a personal knowledge graph that feels more like a treasure map.

## Bonus Tips for the Nerds

- **Write in physical notebooks too.** Slower, messier, but it helps lock things in. A pocket notebook makes you 10x cooler than typing in Notes.
- **Make meta-connections.** Not everything needs to be profound. A dumb clickbait video can still be a chance to reflect on attention psychology.
- **Don't retro-update notes.** Connect from new to old, not vice versa. Otherwise, you'll never stop revising.
- **Avoid the Graph Trap.** Graphs look cool. But don't spend your time tuning colors. You're not doing data viz, you're learning.

This is about our attention. You'll notice a shift: from passive scroll to intentional interaction. If you try this, and actually stick with it, congrats. You're no longer a consumer. You're a **professional digital learner**.
