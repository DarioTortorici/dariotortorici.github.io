# TLDR
Duolingo key lessons on product design, and how they can shape any startup’s success.

---

# Introduction

Recently, [Duolingo released a free handbook](https://handbook.duolingo.com/?utm_source=blog.duolingo.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=handbook_blog_020725) outlining the principles behind building Duolingo. This isn’t just an insightful case study from the leader in language learning and arguably the most important edTech company; it’s also a solid framework for anyone looking to build a startup. I want to share why I found this handbook so compelling and add my humble perspective to the discussion.

# Take the long view

This idea isn’t new, we’ve all heard it before. But hearing it and implementing it are two different things.

> If it helps in the short-term, but hurts Duolingo in the long-term, it’s not right.

Easy to say, hard to execute. Long-term thinking is difficult because its effects aren’t always clear. Moreover, launching a startup is already a struggle. I can’t blame anyone for prioritizing survival with the wrong strategy. But the early stage is both the hardest and the most crucial, it’s the foundation everything else is built on.

> We could increase revenue tomorrow by showing more ads in the app. But we know that too many ads can annoy users and stifle long-term growth, potentially compromising our goal of making the best education universally available.

A good example of this principle is hiring. Applicable from the start:

> We don’t compromise our hiring standards to fill a hole in the organization, especially when it comes to being a team player.

In other words, hire people who are obsessed with your mission, who are technically great, and who want to build the best version of something. If they are truly great at what they do, they are sacrificing an higher salary elsewhere. That's why Duolingo employees (Duos) stay much longer than employees at most tech companies.

# Building a Forever Product

This goes hand in hand with long-term thinking and is perfectly summed up by:

> The Duolingo app is designed to be sticky in the short term and transformative in the long-term.

The stickiness serves the customer’s transformation, not just the company’s cash-flow. I can already hear the skeptics: "I’m building a matchmaking platform for beekeepers and florists, I don’t have a ‘transformative long run’ for my users.".
I understand. In the case of Duollingo, being a language learning app makes things easier, even in the short term.

> Learning—particularly language learning—requires regular practice over extended periods of time.

Let me disagree with you. I can't replace your product-market fit, of course, but if you don't have transformative intent in your mission, you're going to fail. In the example of beekeepers and florists, this is easier than it seems. You want to save the planet. Bees are necessary to maintain the ecosystem, and you want to improve the health of the world. This is a hell of a long term transformation. It doesn't have to be directed at your customer, but it could be a global benefit.

# Engineering the Future

So, long-term investment is the way to go. But how do you evaluate what’s actually good for the long term? And how do you move fast while doing it?

> Focusing on speed while reserving long-term investments for what truly works—has guided our success

Develop the Product and Establish Feedback Mechanisms. This feedback can be obtained from quantitative and qualitative sources. Early-stage projects generally depend more on qualitative feedback before transitioning to data-driven metrics.

> we don’t build systems to last forever. Instead, we test ideas quickly and only invest significant engineering resources when something is successful.

# Becoming a Business

This is the part where ideals meet reality. The need for money.

> We were laser-focused on growing our user base and keeping learners engaged. Also, some of us worried that monetizing Duolingo could get in the way of our mission

That tension is real. Funnily enough this works also in the long-run perspective. If your startup fails tomorrow, your grand vision disappears with it. You have to test how willing users are to stick around when money enters the picture. Sometimes, you’ll realize that your business just isn’t financially viable.

> We found that we could show one ad after each lesson without affecting user retention, but more than that would drive people away. [...] It became clear that introducing a freemium subscription product was the best opportunity to scale the business. The hard part was doing so while still offering an excellent product for those who couldn’t pay. [...]
> Such a great free product would provide too little incentive for learners to subscribe. Approach to monetization has shown that we can strike this balance, achieving long-term loyalty while building a large business

# Raise the bar

> One key to maintaining high standards is assigning ownership. "You are responsible". As we grow, unclear ownership can become a challenge

This is something I've learned recently in the [Simon Sinek journal](https://simonsinek.com/stories/leaders-should-assign-responsibility-not-tasks/). Without clear ownership, even the best teams start to lose focus. When everyone thinks someone else is responsible, nothing moves forward. Assigning ownership ensures that there’s always someone driving each initiative forward.

> “hard on the work, easy on the people.” That means giving constructive, clear feedback that sharpens ideas without undermining relationships

 Criticism should never feel personal. When done right, constructive feedback pushes everyone toward excellence while keeping morale high.

> Another key way we maintain excellence is by using the app daily. [...] we built Shake to Report, a simple tool that lets anyone in the company snapshot and report an issue instantly by shaking their device

Sometimes, we're so caught up in the moment that we forget we should be our first customer.

# Ship it

As you already understood. Is everything a balance between speed and quality.  Faster you ship it, easier is the process to improve the feature as the customer wants.

> Testing in the real world gives us better information than any internal discussion ever could

Don't forget the balance though. Even in MVP's quality is important. Duolingo are really serious about this.

> At Duolingo, we don’t do MVPs—we do V1s. This approach takes a little longer, but we refuse to compromise our users’ experience by showing them half-baked ideas

Building version ones doesn't mean to have everything ready, but at least something small, working properly and nice appealing.

> We cut features that don’t deliver value, remove unnecessary complexity, and stay laser focused on our mission.

# Show don't tell

This is one of the keys in 2025. We shifted how we convey information; from text to more visual contents.

> Our app is designed to be intuitive. Instead of telling learners how to use Duolingo with pop-over messages and lengthy onboarding flows, we let design, animation, and simple prompts do the “showing.”

A good designer is not an optional.

# Make it fun

This is the second key ingredient with "show don't tell" that has made Duolingo, in my opinion, the best language app out there.

> [...] concept for a kids’ app. With brighter colors, rounder corners, and a cuter, friendlier Duo, the new design made learning feel more like a game. It was exactly the kind of playful experience we wanted for the main app

They understood that learning is much faster when it becomes a game. The gamification in Duolingo is the stickiness and long-term change we talked about. It's beautifully implemented with the show don't tell principle, through the other principle to make the actual version happen.

> Our characters make learning fun. [...] Even if someone cloned our entire app, learners would still come back to Duolingo for the characters.

# Conclusion

The very existence of this handbook gives me hope for the future of startups. We’ve grown used to the enshittification of products, but Duolingo proves that it doesn’t have to be that way.

> Build a product that people genuinely love

This handbook is a masterclass in doing just that. While this article has focused more on product strategy, there are also valuable lessons in other areas. From hiring, where Duolingo sets a high bar for mission-driven talent, to marketing, where Duo the owl has become an iconic brand mascot recognized even by people who don’t use the app. If you care about building something meaningful, this is a must-read.
