# TLDR

A recent MIT study claims using ChatGPT reduces brain capabilities. Rather than fearing AI, we should teach people to use it thoughtfully.

---

# Introduction

I'm late to the conversation about the latest viral paper. A recent MIT study said, more or less, that ChatGPT is bad for your brain. Let's explore what this 206-page document says and determine if that's really the case.

# The Study

The study is titled ["Your Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt When Using an AI Assistant for an Essay-Writing Task.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08872) 54 university students were split into three groups: one group wrote essays without tools; one group used only Google; and one group used ChatGPT.

Each participant wrote for 20 minutes in three different sessions while their brain activity was measured via electroencephalography (EEG). Later, they were asked to recall and cite their work.

The study shows that the ChatGPT group had the lowest brain activity, particularly in areas associated with creativity, as indicated by lower alpha wave activity. Those who wrote without tools showed the highest engagement. This makes sense because they didn't write the sentences themselves. Unsurprisingly, others reported not feeling like they â€œowned" their texts.

This was interpreted as evidence of potential "cognitive debt." This new term, introduced in the paper, refers to the cost incurred by relying too heavily on AI tools for thinking.

However, before jumping to conclusions, several issues are worth highlighting.

# Study Limitations

First, the sample size is small and homogeneous: just 54 students from Boston-area universities.

Second, the methodology does not reflect how most people actually use ChatGPT. Participants in the AI group were asked to write an entire essay using ChatGPT alone. They weren't prompted to collaborate with ChatGPT, revise drafts, or use it for brainstorming. In short, they used ChatGPT as a substitute, not a partner.

Additionally, the study has not undergone peer review, and the authors themselves acknowledge that it does not address long-term effects. Therefore, the concept of "cognitive debt" is interesting, yet still a hypothesis.

# Productivity and Mastery Tradeoff

This is not a new dilemma. Every tool that improves productivity comes with a tradeoff in skill. Calculators made arithmetic faster, but arguably made us worse at mental math. That doesn't make calculators bad. It just means we need to be intentional about when to use them, and when not to.

Same with ChatGPT. If it writes all your emails, you might get faster. But you might also lose fluency over time. The key is balance and awareness.

That's why education is the key. Students are using AI tools, whether we like it or not. The best response isn't restriction. Show students how to use these tools as collaborators, not shortcuts. The same applies for adults. Use AI to speed up the boring parts, sure. But recognize that relying too much on external tools can dull your skills over time. It won't happen overnight, but it happens.

# Conclusion

The study's main contribution isn't a definitive answer, but a useful reminder: offloading cognitive effort has consequences. Sometimes that's fine, even necessary. Other times, it's worth slowing down and doing the work ourselves.

So, does using ChatGPT turn off your brain? It depends. It may alter how and when we choose to use it. That's a decision worth making consciously. As AI tools become more integrated into our lives, the real challenge is not resisting them, but rather using them responsibly.
