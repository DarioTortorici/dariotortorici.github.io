# TLDR
Short case study on the Open Collective's decision to move to the community and how to manage it with money.

---

# Introduction

Open Collective is a crowdfunding platform designed to support grassroots organizations, communities, and projects by providing them with the legal status they need to raise funds through subscriptions or one-time payments. The company generates revenue by taking a percentage of these funds raised by the communities it hosts. The platform is especially popular among open-source initiatives.

Recently, Open Collective made a significant transition, shifting from a for-profit business model to a community-driven non-profit. This change, known as the "Exit to Community" model, hands control of the platform over to the very community of users, fiscal hosts, and collectives who have relied on Open Collective for transparency, trust, and mutual support. This move reflects Open Collective’s ongoing commitment to openness and a more sustainable, community-centric future.

# Governance Structure: A Community-Owned Model

The most significant change in Open Collective's transition to a non-profit is its governance structure. In contrast to traditional startups, which are typically owned and controlled by private stakeholders and experience dilution of ownership with each round of investment, Open Collective has strategically maintained control after the [funding rounds](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/about/investors?ref=blog.opencollective.com), at the expense of a faster growth.
The company always intended to exit in a "non-traditional" way, through an "Exit to Community" model. This means there are no large shares to sell or the typical financial windfall associated with a startup acquisition.

> People know what it feels like to be on a tech platform where they _are_ the product instead of the ones _using_ the product, which is the case for so much mainstream tech out there. We don't want that, and our community doesn't want that
> — _Alanna Irving_, Open Collective COO

In this new phase, the non-profit will be governed by a board of directors made up primarily of stakeholders from the community. Reflecting its commitment to "community governance," the board will include key figures from fiscal host organizations as well as members of the Open Collective executive team. As you can see, this structure ensures that the community remains at the heart of the platform's decision-making process.
The governance model of Open Collective is designed to be inclusive and transparent; principles the platform has long represented. Transparency has always been at the core of its values, not only in terms of its [open-source code.](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective) but also in making [every financial transaction publicly available for review.](https://opencollective.com/opencollective#category-BUDGET)

# The Financial Sustainability of the Non-Profit Model

But this transition also brings its own challenges. While consensus-based governance can sometimes slow down decision-making, the more pressing issue is money.

Open Collective's financial model is based on community contributions, platform fees, and funding. To safeguard its financial sustainability, the organization has outlined a clear plan.

The non-profit received seed funding from Open Collective Inc. to cover initial operational costs, which prevents disruption for the existing community members. This initial capital helps the non-profit stabilize and provides a buffer as it transitions to its new form. This financial cushion allows the non-profit to focus on its mission without having to worry about short-term revenue generation.
Another important source of revenue remain the fees and tips that users pay on the platform that will now flow directly into the non-profit’s coffers.

Despite initial funding and ongoing platform fees, there are inherent risks in relying on donations and platform fees as the primary sources of revenue. Non-profits often face challenges in balancing financial sustainability with growth. One potential risk is that the non-profit may struggle to scale quickly enough to compete with for-profit alternatives.

I would now like to share the CEO’s vision for addressing this challenge:

> I don't want to spend my life growing for growth's sake
> — _Pia Mancini_, Open Collective CEO

The company is betting that the funds raised so far have been sufficient to build a robust infrastructure, one that will now only require ongoing maintenance.

The company currently has a balance of $622,000 USD. Last year, its total expenses amounted to approximately $1,400,000 USD, while its revenue was $500,000 USD. The current financial situation is precarious, without substantial growth in revenue from platform fees, community contributions, or alternative funding sources, the organization faces a funding gap that could jeopardize its operations within the next fiscal year.

# My opinion about it

I propose you this case study to present an intriguing experiment for consideration. I have never observed a community-driven economy. The underlying financial challenges underscore the tensions between idealism and the realities of sustaining such a model in a capitalist society. It is my hope that the success of Open Collective's "Exit to Community" model will be sustained and that it will serve as an exemplar, and perhaps even a paradigm shift.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, Open Collective’s Exit to Community model is a bold experiment in prioritizing community over capital. While its long-term success is not guaranteed, its commitment to transparency, trust, and sustainability offers a compelling alternative to the profit-driven status quo. Would Open Collective’s partners remain committed if they were asked to increase their contributions solely to uphold the company’s ideals?
